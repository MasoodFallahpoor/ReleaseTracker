Release Tracker is an Android app that shows the latest version of some popular Android libraries.

![Screenshots](/screenshots/screenshots_1.png?raw=true "Screenshots")

# How it works
There is a [worker](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) that runs 3 times a day. In each run, for each library, it connects to the [Github REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest) and fetches the latest version of the library.

# How to build
To build the app, clone the repository and import it into Android Studio. Then add the following line to `local.properties` with your own [Github personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens):

`accessToken = YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`

Now you're good to go. Good luck!


If you want to track the latest version of AndroidX libraries then take a look at [Jetpack Release Tracker](https://github.com/lmj0011/jetpack-release-tracker).
